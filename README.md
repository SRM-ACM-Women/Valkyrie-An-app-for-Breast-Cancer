 About the app: https://youtu.be/pb5i1ogycEU


Inspiration
The best protection is early detection. We aim to focus on providing care to potential patients and to enhance the general welfare of millions of women around the world.What it does
1) The first section is self-examination, this redirects you to a youtube video which helps the user self diagnose.
2) The next is to Check your risk level, many people tend to do the doctor even for a small rash, which increases the workload of a doctor. This section provides the user with a questionnaire to determine if they really need to see an oncologist.
3) Next is Reminder alerts we are not yet done with the coding but this section stores all of the user's appointments and medical check-up dates.
4) A nearby oncologist redirects you to a page for oncologists near you. We are working on doing that in the app itself.
5) The self-help section helps the cancer patient emotionally. People are traumatized when they get to know they are diagnosed, this section points to all the therapists and counsellors near the user.
6) What next is a section telling the user the journey of a cancer patient from day 1.
7) Blogs provide additional and much-required information for cancer patientsHow we built it
We built it using Flutter and Android Studio. We also used Collected data from google images, Google colab, python, and TensorFlow for the AI model.Challenges we ran into
This being our first-ever hackathon, we came across a lot of new things. Apart from teamwork, we learned how an app for our case comes together. The many changes we needed to make before all of us were completely satisfied. We didn't have proper datasets to work with and faced issues initially but the four of us managed and have left scope open for it in the futureWhat's next for Valkyrie
With better datasets, questionnaires with better medical details, and tie-ups with hospitals, we look forward to having an even more reliable app.

We've also prepared an AI model which we're looking to incorporate in our app. The model is a cnn based binary classifier which predicts the input image to be benign or malignant. Due to the low availability of data our model might not be perfect rightnow but we're what we're looking at is a lot of scope for improvement.
